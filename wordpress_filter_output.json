On the main level of the cabin, you&amp;#39;ll find floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room with a large wood-burning fireplace, 40&amp;rdquo; smart tv (Netflix, Hula, Amazon), and an extra large comfy sectional. The dining room consists of a custom 9 person farmhouse table and bench, perfect and roomy for your family and friends to enjoy a meal. You&amp;#39;ll also find the kitchen on this level, stocked with all the pots, pans, and any cooking items you&amp;#39;ll need during your stay in addition to updated appliances. The kitchen comes equipped with a Keurig and a regular coffee machine. There is also a propane grill on the back deck available for use. Also, the house is equipped with Rabbit Air purifiers on each floor.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can find one full bathroom on the main level with a tiled tub and shower and a bathroom with a shower on the lowest level. This cabin may have been built in 1970 but all of the upgrades and renovations mean plenty of hot water and great water pressure for all the guests. Off of the main floor, there is a large wrap-around deck around the home with a custom wood table and umbrella, outdoor furniture, including a fire pit, and lounge seating for many on the front and back sides where you can watch the shooting stars. (It&amp;#39;s my favorite spot for morning coffee.) If you look up you can see the ski resort and since we are sitting high on the street, you won&amp;#39;t be looking into neighbors&amp;#39; windows, but instead, you&amp;#39;ll have a perfect view of trees, mountains, and the slopes. Upstairs you&amp;#39;ll find both bedrooms. The master bedroom is a loft and overlooks the living room. It has the most amazing view of the trees and mountains. If you tire of the view, there is a 40&amp;quot; smart tv and retro malm wood-burning fireplace to keep you warm and toasty if you&amp;#39;re visiting in the winter. The guest bedroom has a queen-sized bed and two twin bunk beds. There is a private balcony attached to this room. The backyard is woodsy and quiet so this is the perfect place for an afternoon nap or to read a book and relax.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDownstairs is where all the fun happens! There is a full-sized pool table, a poker/chess/card table, electronic dartboard game, and is fully stocked with board games and puzzles! There is also a Super-Sac LoveSac and Love-Sac Moonpit Lounger. The lounger is the size of 2 queen size beds and easily sleeps 4 adults. There is also a 120&amp;rdquo; projection screen with surround sound for the perfect movie night! We also have a Nintendo Classic and the projection screen is equipped with Apple TV. On the deck, there is a 6 person hot tub (cleaned weekly) with gorgeous ski slope and mountain views. Additionally, you can find 2 twin air mattresses to use on this level or upstairs in the main living room, whatever fits your sleeping arrangements. This is great for adults and kids alike!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is also a second full bath on this level with a large walk-in shower. This is where you can find the washer and dryer and anything you need to do laundry. All carpets, upholstery, area rugs, and mattresses are cleaned regularly. There are several speakers throughout the cabin equipped with Amazon Music. Many of the lights are controlled and the home is Nest thermostat controlled. There is also high-speed WIFI through the house.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n**New Addition** In the backyard, with a giant 7.5&amp;rsquo; window facing the woods, you&amp;rsquo;ll find 100 square feet of triangle perfection.

If you have a large truck or SUV, there may only be room for 2. There is no street parking.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPlease be aware that during winter months, chains and/or 4WD are often required to enter Big Bear. During the snowy months, the mountain is not safe to drive without them and the city does enforce these requirements. Our driveway is also on a slope, so if it is snowy, you will need chains or 4WD to park.

On the main level of the cabin, you'll find floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room with a large wood-burning fireplace, 40\" smart tv (Netflix, Hula, Amazon), and an extra large comfy sectional. The dining room consists of a custom 9 person farmhouse table and bench, perfect and roomy for your family and friends to enjoy a meal. You'll also find the kitchen on this level, stocked with all the pots, pans, and any cooking items you'll need during your stay in addition to updated appliances. The kitchen comes equipped with a Keurig and a regular coffee machine. There is also a propane grill on the back deck available for use. Also, the house is equipped with Rabbit Air purifiers on each floor.\n\nYou can find one full bathroom on the main level with a tiled tub and shower and a bathroom with a shower on the lowest level. This cabin may have been built in 1970 but all of the upgrades and renovations mean plenty of hot water and great water pressure for all the guests. Off of the main floor, there is a large wrap-around deck around the home with a custom wood table and umbrella, outdoor furniture, including a fire pit, and lounge seating for many on the front and back sides where you can watch the shooting stars. (It's my favorite spot for morning coffee.) If you look up you can see the ski resort and since we are sitting high on the street, you won't be looking into neighbors' windows, but instead, you'll have a perfect view of trees, mountains, and the slopes. Upstairs you'll find both bedrooms. The master bedroom is a loft and overlooks the living room. It has the most amazing view of the trees and mountains. If you tire of the view, there is a 40\" smart tv and retro malm wood-burning fireplace to keep you warm and toasty if you're visiting in the winter. The guest bedroom has a queen-sized bed and two twin bunk beds. There is a private balcony attached to this room. The backyard is woodsy and quiet so this is the perfect place for an afternoon nap or to read a book and relax.\n\nDownstairs is where all the fun happens! There is a full-sized pool table, a poker/chess/card table, electronic dartboard game, and is fully stocked with board games and puzzles! There is also a Super-Sac LoveSac and Love-Sac Moonpit Lounger. The lounger is the size of 2 queen size beds and easily sleeps 4 adults. There is also a 120\" projection screen with surround sound for the perfect movie night! We also have a Nintendo Classic and the projection screen is equipped with Apple TV. On the deck, there is a 6 person hot tub (cleaned weekly) with gorgeous ski slope and mountain views. Additionally, you can find 2 twin air mattresses to use on this level or upstairs in the main living room, whatever fits your sleeping arrangements. This is great for adults and kids alike!\n\nThere is also a second full bath on this level with a large walk-in shower. This is where you can find the washer and dryer and anything you need to do laundry. All carpets, upholstery, area rugs, and mattresses are cleaned regularly. There are several speakers throughout the cabin equipped with Amazon Music. Many of the lights are controlled and the home is Nest thermostat controlled. There is also high-speed WIFI through the house.\n\n**New Addition** In the backyard, with a giant 7.5' window facing the woods, you'll find 100 square feet of triangle perfection. With just enough room for a king-sized bed, this is the perfect spot to nap, read a book, stargaze or watch the snowfall. The driveway can accommodate a maximum of 3 vehicles. If you have a large truck or SUV, there may only be room for 2. There is no street parking.\n\nPlease be aware that during winter months, chains and/or 4WD are often required to enter Big Bear. During the snowy months, the mountain is not safe to drive without them and the city does enforce these requirements. Our driveway is also on a slope, so if it is snowy, you will need chains or 4WD to park. If you have any questions about this, feel free to message us.\n\nGuest access\nYou'll have access to the entire cabin minus a small owner's closet that is attached to the laundry room where we keep cleaning supplies, house and yard tools.\n\nOther things to note\nWe have two bikes located on the property for guests to use. The street in front of the house is perfect for an afternoon bike ride or walk. These are cruiser bikes, not mountain bikes, and are perfect for the lake paths or roads.\n\nThere is a propane grill on the back deck available for guests' use.\n\nThe home is equipped with Ring cameras on the exterior of the home. This provides a safe environment for our guests and ensures that occupancy, pet policies are rules are followed\n\nSleeping Arrangements:\nMaster Bedroom/LOFT - King Bed, Flat Screen Smart TV, wood burning Fireplace - This room overlooks the living room with spectacular views of the forest through the living room vaulted ceiling windows.\nBedroom 2 - 1 Queen Bed, 1 Twin/Twin Bunk Bed\n\nMax Adults: 6\nMax Children: 4\nMax Occupancy: 10\n\nPermit #: VRR-2025-0643\nParking - 2 Cars Max - Steep Slope will require 4X4 during snow conditions, no low profile cars please\nPets - NO pets allowed - Owner has severe allergies","floor_name":"Ground & Upper","not_show_on_website":0,"creation_date":"08/01/2021 13:13:17","property_code":"2066","housekeeping_zone_id":1961,"region":null,"community":null,"use_streamshare":0,"allowed_vehicles":0,"max_vehicles":0,"half_bathrooms_number":0,"location_original_id":null,"property_group_id":663,"lock_box_code":"Code: 5458 - Keyless entry 181920  || Bicycles LB Code1970","lock_box_directions":"","default_vendor_id":null,"homeaway_override_calendar":null,"last_reservation_update":"02/18/2026 12:50:15 PST","country_id":227,"city_id":2579,"community_id":null,"region_id":null,"continent_id":6,"continent_name":"North America","continent_description":null,"state_id":5,"daily_pricing_starting":0,"weekly_pricing_starting":0,"monthly_pricing_starting":0,"view_water_id":3223,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"default_image_path":"https://gallery.streamlinevrs.com/stl-default-images/839/home/452763/1755026541_image.png","default_thumbnail_path":"https://gallery.streamlinevrs.com/stl-default-images/839/home/452763/1755026541_thumbnail.png","online_bookings":1,"inspection_view":0},{"id":485542,"parent_id":null,"search_position":0,"local_phone":"","wifi_name":null,"wifi_security_key":"NET MyCharterWiFi01-2G PASS freshshrub302","type_id":1,"seo_title":"Bear Cub Cabin #2069 | Cabin in Big Bear | Big Bear Vacation","seo_description":"This is a beautiful 2-bedroom cabin in Big Bear in a secluded central location close to local activities and Bear Mountain Resort, perfect for your vacation to the mountains.
